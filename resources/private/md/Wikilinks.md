Wikilinks are simply internal links within the wiki. That is, they just point to different pages within the wiki. They do not point to locations external to the wiki.

However, just as with most wikis, CWiki supports HTML links which can point to other sites on the Internet.

See the [[Links Primer]] for more information.
