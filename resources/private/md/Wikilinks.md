Wikilinks are internal links within the wiki. That is, they point to different pages within the wiki. They do not leadâ€‹ to locations external to the wiki.

However, just as with most wikis, CWiki supports HTML links which can point to other sites on the Internet.

See the [[Links Primer]] for more information.
