The Markdown editor in CWiki can respond to keyboard shortcuts, just like most editors. Since the CWiki editor is based on an HTML `textarea` control, it supports a slew of shortcuts "out of the box." In addition, different operating systems and browsers seem to have their own set of additional shortcuts. And CWiki has some of its own.
