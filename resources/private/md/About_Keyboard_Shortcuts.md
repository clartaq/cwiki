â€‹The Markdown editor in CWiki can respond to keyboard shortcuts, just like most editors. Since the CWiki editor is based on an HTML `textarea` control, it supports a slew of shortcuts "out of the box." Also, different operating systems and browsers seem to have their own set of additional shortcuts. And CWiki has some of its own.

## Operating System Level Shortcuts ##

## Browser Level Shortcuts ##

## CWiki Specific Shortcuts ##

### Shortcuts Available Anywhere in on the Editor Page ###

**Save Changes** - `ctrl/cmd-s` - Saves all of the changes made since the last save or when the page was loaded into the editor.

### Shortcuts Only Available in the Markdown Pane ###

**Insert Timestamp*** - `alt/opt-ctrl/cmd-t` - Inserts a timestamp like this, `02 Dec 2018, 05:47:45 pm`, into the text. **Note:** This key is right next to the `r` key on US keyboards. Pressing `alt/opt-ctrl/cmd-r` instead will reload the page in the editor, losing any unsaved changes.
