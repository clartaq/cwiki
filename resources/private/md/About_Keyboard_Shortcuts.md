The Markdown editor in CWiki can respond to keyboard shortcuts, just like most editors. Since the CWiki editor is based on an HTML `textarea` control, it supports a slew of shortcuts "out of the box." Also, different operating systems and browsers seem to have their own set of additional shortcuts. And CWiki has some of its own.

## Operating System Level Shortcuts ##

## Browser Level Shortcuts ##

## CWiki Specific Shortcuts ##

### Shortcuts Available Anywhere in on the Editor Page ###

**Save Changes** - `ctrl/cmd-s` - Saves all of the changes made since the last save or when the page was loaded into the editor.

**Quit the Editor** - `ctrl/cmd-alt/opt-x` Quits the editor and returns to the reading view. If there are unsaved changes, you will be asked to confirm your choice to exit the editor. **Note:** This key is very similar to the shortcut to exit the _browser_ altogether. Don't mix them up!

### Shortcuts Only Available in Text Inputs ###

These shortcuts will only work when the cursor is in a text input like the title, a tag, or the Markdown Pane.

**Insert Timestamp** - `ctrl/cmd-alt/opt-t` - Inserts a timestamp like this, `02 Dec 2018, 05:47:45 pm`, into the text. **Note:** This key is right next to the `r` key on US keyboards. Pressing `ctrl/cmd-alt/opt-r` instead will reload the page in the editor, losing any unsaved changes.

**Encode Selection** - This one is a bit odd. I use it to help create navigation links within a page. Since within-pageâ€‹ navigation links should be well-formed URLs, some characters, like spaces and punctuation, cannot be used in the links. This shortcut `ctrl/cmd-alt/opt-e`, percent encodes the selection, producing a "URL-safe" for linking.
