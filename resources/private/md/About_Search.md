​CWiki supports some basic search functionality.

### Authors ###

You can see all of the authors known to the wiki by going to the [[All Users]] link. That link is usually listed on the [[Sidebar]]. From that page, you can click the name of the user (author) to see all of the pages attributed to that user.

### Tags ###

You can see all the tags known to the wiki by going to the [[All Tags]] page. It's usually linked in the [[Sidebar]].

### Titles ###

You can see all of the pages in the wiki by going to the [[All Pages]] special page. There is usually a link to that page in the [[Sidebar]].

Clicking that link will produce a list of links to all of the pages in the wiki. Clicking any of the titles in the links will take you to a page.

### Full Text Search ###

CWiki has a basic ability to search the content of all of the pages in the wiki. Up in the top right area of the web page, there is a search box for entering search terms, and a button to initiate the search.

If any results are found, the titles of the pages containing the search terms are displayed. The program presents​ results in order of "relevance," that is, in the order that the program thinks are most important at the beginning and least significant at the end.

At present, the wiki will only search based on a single search term. Although sophisticated tools are underlying the search, my feeble development skills do not allow you to get very fancy. This is expected to change in the future.
