You can "encode" a string in the editor by highlighting it and then tapping the keyboard shortcut `ctrlâ€‹/cmd-alt/opt-e`. This action replaces the selection with the "encoded" version.

The type of encoding is called "[percent encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding)" and is used to make strings that can be used in [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL)s by translating reserved characters into "safe" alternatives.

This is the same technique that [[About CWiki|CWiki]] uses the create [[Wikilinks]] that contain punctuation characters that are not allowed in URLs.
