This is the **Front Page** of your new [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki). This particular wiki goes by the name of [[About CWiki|CWiki]].

As the article linked above describes, a wiki is a program that allows you to organize (or not) bits of information that you want to record somewhere. A wiki differs from a note-taking application in that it allows you to link it's various parts together. For example, scattered throughout this page are links to both external websitesâ€‹ and pages maintained in a database on your local computer.

## Getting Started ##

The [[Features]] page describes some of the features of CWiki.

There is a [[CWiki FAQ|FAQ]] with answers to a few common questions about CWiki.

If you are the **admin** for the wiki, read [[About Admin Pages]] for some background on what you can do.

### Read Some of What's Already Here ###

Over on the left, in the [[About the Sidebar|Sidebar]] you will see a section titled "Useful Links". There's a link to [[All Pages]]. Clicking it will show you all the pages in the wiki. The [[All Pages]] link creates the page whenever you click it, so it will always show you an up-to-date list of pages.

Take a look.

### Create Some of Your Own Pages ###

The whole point is to create your own pages. Check out the [[Pages Primer]] for guidance on how to do that. Start building what you want.
