Sometimes you want to link to sections within a page, in a [[How to Make a Table of Contents|Table of Contents]] for example.

An easy way for me to do that is to use an encoded timestamp. After creating the timestamp, [[How to Encode a String in the Editor|encode]] it to make a safe URL, then use that as the link target.
