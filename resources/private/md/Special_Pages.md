This wiki contains a number of "Special" pages. These pages cannot be removed or renamed. Some can be edited, like the "About" page; others are generated by the wiki as it runs, like the "All Pages" page.

Here is a complete list.

### Front Page ###

The [[Front Page]] is the first page the wiki displays when it starts up. It is also the page that is displayed if the wiki ever gets into a state where it cannot figure out what should be displayed. You can edit it's contents, but you cannot change the name.

- **Editable**: True  
- **Deletable**: False
- **Generated**: False

### Special Pages ###

This page. As you can see, it describes pages that the program considers special.

- **Editable**: False  
- **Deletable**: False
- **Generated**: False

### About ###

The [[About]] page can be used to record some information about the wiki in general. You should edit it to reflect your intentions for the wiki. This is not a very special page since you can edit it and even delete it. The only thing that makes it special is that, if the page exists, there is a link to it in the navigation bar at the top of the browser window.

- **Editable**: True  
- **Deletable**: True
- **Generated**: False

### Sidebar ###

This is a special area off to the left of the main display area. It can be used as a special place to put links that are useful from anywhere in the wiki. The list of links can be broken into sections to group links with related functionality. See [[Sidebar|The Sidebar]] for details on changing the content of this area.

- **Editable**: True  
- **Deletable**: False
- **Generated**: False

### Preferences ###

You can use the [[Preferences]] page to change some of the settings that control how the program operates. Be very careful in editing this page. If the program cannot understand the content of the edited page, it will reset everything to the defaults that were used when the program first started.

- **Editable**: True  
- **Deletable**: False
- **Generated**: False

### All Pages ###

This page is generated by the program every time you load it. As it's name suggests, it will create a page that lists the titles of all of the pages in the wiki database. You can view [[All Pages]] by clicking the link.

- **Editable**: False  
- **Deletable**: False
- **Generated**: True

### All Users ###

This page is generated by the program every time you load it. As it's name suggests, it will create a page that lists all of the users known to the wiki. You can view [[All Users]] by clicking the link.

- **Editable**: False  
- **Deletable**: False
- **Generated**: True

### All Tags ###

This page is generated by the program every time you load it. This page will display a list of all of the tags used in the wiki. You can view [[All Tags]] by clicking the link.

- **Editable**: False  
- **Deletable**: False
- **Generated**: True

### Orphans ###

This is another page that is generated by the program. When invoked, it will search the database for pages that don't appear to be referenced from anywhere else in the wiki. There is nothing wrong with creating such pages, you just have to remember the name in order to find it again. Or examine the contents of the [[Orphans]] page.

There are some orphan pages intentionally placed in the wiki when it is first used. These are just for testing purposes. If you don't want them taking up space, just delete them.

- **Editable**: False  
- **Deletable**: False
- **Generated**: True

## Admin Pages ##

These are pages that can only be opened by a user with "admin" or administration privileges.

See [[About Admin Pages]] for more information.
