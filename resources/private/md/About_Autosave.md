By default, changes you make in the editor will be saved automatically after a short period of keyboard inactivity.

You can change the duration of inactivity on the [[preferences|Preferences]] page. Enter the number of seconds of inactivity that should elapse before automatically saving changes. If you _never_ want changes to be saved automatically, enter a setting of zero (0).

**Note:** The content of new pages (pages created by clicking the "New" menu item) will not be saved until the Page Title has been changed from the default value. That is, when you create a new page, the Page Title is shown as "A New Page."â€‹ Until you change the title, autosave will not save any other work on the page.
