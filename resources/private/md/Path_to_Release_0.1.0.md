Things to accomplish before release 0.1.0:

- ~~Settle on the â€‹database to use.~~ Done. Now using [H2](http://h2database.com/html/main.html).
- ~~Finish implementation of tags.~~ Done. Editing interface is ugly but it works.
- ~~Implement page import and export.~~ Done.
- ~~Implement full text search.~~ Done.
- ~~Make contents of "All Users" and "All Tags" pages clickable links.~~ Done.
- ~~Integrate Writing Markdown editor.~~ Done. Actually wrote a simple editor in ClojureScript.
- ~~Rationalize CSS, particularly for code listings.~~ Done. ~~Now needs to be done again.~~ Done again. All CSS exists in one file. The "normal" view of wiki pages looks pretty close to the appearance in the editor preview pane.
- ~~Test operation when installed on a server.~~ Done.
- Complete documentation pages.
