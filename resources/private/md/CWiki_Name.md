CWiki -- where did that name come from and how do you pronounce it?

I assume that the "Wiki" part is obvious since this is a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) program. The "C" part is there since the program is written in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).

I find myself pronouncing "CWiki" in two ways. Originally, it was pronounced "See Wiki" to emphasize the "C" Clojure part. But nowadays I just pronounce it as a homonym of "quickie" which pays homage to the original naming of wikis, where "wiki" means "quick". So "CWiki" can sound like "quick" and behave that way as well.
