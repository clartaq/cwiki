CWiki -- where did that name come from and how do you pronounce it?

I assume that the "Wiki" part is obvious since this is a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) program. The "C" part is there since the program is written in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).

I find myself pronouncing "CWiki" in two ways. Originally, it was pronounced "See Wiki" to emphasize the "C" Clojure part. But nowadays I just pronounce it as a homonym of "quickie" which pays homage to the original naming of wikis, where "wiki" means "quick". So "CWiki" can sound like "quick" and behave that way as well.

Ho, ho, ho! I'm so clever ;-)
