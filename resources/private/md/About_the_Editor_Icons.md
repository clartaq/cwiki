The icons used in the editor button bar are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com) _via_ [fontello](http://fontello.com). All are licensed by the [SIL Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).

The icons used to delete and add tags are SVG from a source that I have lost.
