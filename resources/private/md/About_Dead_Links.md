â€‹**THIS IS NOT READY YET**

Dead links are wikilinks in a page that point to non-existent pages. If you view a page, any dead links will be displayed in red.

Maybe the page linked to was deleted. Perhaps the link itself is misspelled. Maybe it hasn't been created yet.

There is usually at least one dead link in the wiki; the [[Pages Primer]] contains one as an example.

You can look through your database to find all dead links by clicking the [[Dead Links]] link here or in the default [[Sidebar]].

**Note**: Finding all dead links may take quite some time.
