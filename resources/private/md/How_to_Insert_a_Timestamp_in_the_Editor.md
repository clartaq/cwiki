Often, I like to record the date and time that I write something. To make it easy, there is an icon in the toolbar. It looks like a clock.

There is also a keyboard shortcut, `ctrl/cmd-alt/opt-t` that will insert a timestamp like this:

31 Dec 2018, 11:02:15 am

Sorry, that is the only format that is supported at the moment.

**Note:** In Safari, the shortcut is very similar to the one that will reload the page (`ctrl/cmd-alt/opt-t`) losing your work. Don't get them mixed up!
