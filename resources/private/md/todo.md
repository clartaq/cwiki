This is an ever-evolving list of things that need doing.

* Somewhere along the way, I introduced a huge bug in the routing created when you try to create a new page from the "New" item in the nav bar.
* Import/Export of pages to files. Would let me do actual editing in CWiki and save the pages back to a file for use in setting up the "Initial Pages".
* Consolidate some of the nav stuff in the page header into a "More" drop-down menu.
* New page creation should check for an existing page of the same name before saving.
* Make searches case-insensitive for the first letter in the page name.
* Implement Namespaces? Would make separating out groups of pages easier, like all "Help" pages.
* Add a tagging system. Look into hierarchical tagging systems.
* Implement within-wiki search.
* Any maintenance tasks to perform? Database compression for example.
* How to handle images. Should they go in a the database? (Almost certainly yes.)
* Beautify and style the edit/create pages.
* Rationalize the CSS
* At some point, we are going to have to stop creating the initial database from a bunch of Markdown files and just add a pre-built database to the repository. Need to get the tools within CWiki into better shape.
* Backup and restore for the database.
* Make page lookup from links case-insensitive for the first letter in words.
* Add the ability to generate a Table of Contents (TOC) for long pages.
* Version tracking?
* ~~Be consistent in the use of the name -- either "CWiki" or "cwiki".~~
* ~~Layout and use the Sidebar.~~
* ~~Add extensions and CSS for tables.~~
* ~~The edit and create pages should not have a "Delete" link in the nav bar.~~
* ~~Put role-based users in place.~~
*  ~~The routes to the admin pages are spelled, hyphenated, and capitalized differently in different places in the program.~~
*  ~~For users with the "reader" role, links to non-existent pages should be disabled rather than showing a normal, clickable link that then throws an error message.~~
* ~~Add validation to login page and other forms.~~
