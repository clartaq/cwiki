This is an ever-evolving list of things that need doing.

* ~~Be consistent in the use of the name -- either "CWiki" or "cwiki".~~
* ~~Layout and use the Sidebar.~~
* Put role-based users in place.
* The edit and create pages should not have a "Delete" link in the nav bar.
* Make searches case-insensitive for the first letter in the page name.
* Implement Namespaces? Would make separating out groups of pages easier, like all "Help" pages.
* Add a tagging system. Look into hierarchical tagging systems.
* Implement within-wiki search.
* Any maintenance tasks to perform? Database compression for example.
* How to handle images. Should they go in a the database? (Almost certainly yes.)
* ~~Add extensions and CSS for tables.~~
* Beautify and style the edit/create pages.
* Rationalize the CSS
* At some point, we are going to have to stop creating the initial database from a bunch of Markdown files and just add a pre-built database to the repository. Need to get the tools within CWiki into better shape.
* Backup and restore for the database.
* Import/Export. Export pages to Markdown, HTML, PDF (?).
* Add the ability to generate a Table of Contents (TOC) for long pages.
* Version tracking.
