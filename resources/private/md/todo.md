This is an ever-evolving list of things that need doing.

* Be consistent in the use of the name -- either "CWiki" or "cwiki".
* Layout and use the Sidebar.
* Put role-based users in place.
* The edit and create pages should not have a "Delete" link in the nav bar.
* Make searches case-insensitive for the first letter in the page name.
* Implement Namespaces? Would make separating out groups of pages easier, like all "Help" pages.
* Add a tagging system.
* Implement within-wiki search.
* Any maintenance tasks to perform? Database compression for example.
* How to handle images. Should they go in a the database? (Almost certainly yes.)
* Tables?
* Beautify and style the edit/create pages.
