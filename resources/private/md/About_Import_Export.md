CWiki lets you import ([[About Roles|if you are allowed]]) and export content from the wiki to the file system and *vice versa*. There are two ways to do it, explained below.

## Cut and Paste ##

Since you can open a page to edit most pages ([[About Roles|if you are allowed]]), you can export it by using "Select All" (`Ctrl-A`) and "Copy" (`Ctrl-C`) any existing page. Then you can paste what you have copied into any other program.

Import is just as easy. [[Pages Primer|Create a new page]] (click "New" up in the window header) and paste your content into the edit window.

## Reading and Writing to the File System ##

This method can be more convenient in some cases. If your role is a "reader", it is you only option since you will not be able to open an editing page. Readers can only export, they are not allowed to import content in to the wiki.

### Restrictions ###

When importing from a file, the author of the page will become the currently logged in user.
