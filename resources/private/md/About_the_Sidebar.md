The [[Sidebar]] is a special location on the screen and one of the [[Special Pages]] used in this wiki. It's on the left side of the browser window. Things there look a little smaller than the page view where you're reading this.

It's purpose is to provide a place to put often-used information so you don't have to go searching through the whole wiki to find them. The wiki comes with some default content for the sidebar, but you can edit it an customize it for your particular needs.

Since it's just another wiki page, albeit a special one, you can edit it just by clicking a link in any other page on the wiki, like this one: [[Sidebar]]. Then click the `Edit` item at the top of the page.

Once you are in the editing window, you can just make the modifications you want.

As mentioned above, the contents of the Sidebar are styled a little differently than the main area. It's really designed to handle plain text, a header style (the sixth level header), and links. If you stick to those you should be okay. Using other styles, like listings or math might produce some truly ugly or unusable results.

So think of the things you think are most useful and stick links to them in the Sidebar.
