**THIS IS NOT READY YET**

Back links are pages in the wiki that have links pointing to the currently displayed page. They are an interesting way to discover previously unrecognized relationships between topics.

You can look through your database to find all back links to the current page by clicking the [[Back Links]] link here or in the default [[Sidebar]].

**Note**: Finding all back links may take quite some time.
