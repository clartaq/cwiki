These are some technical notes about CWiki. If you are only interested in using the wiki, you can ignore this stuff. If you want to know how CWiki works or why it works the way it does or how to build and modify your own version, the information here might be useful.

## Software Dependencies ##

Almost no software is written without dependencies these days -- programs are just too complicated. CWiki is no different. Some useful functionality has already been written by others. You can look at the program project file, `project.clj` to see exactly what is in there.  Here's a list.

### Java Stuff ###

* Developed and tested on late versions of Java 8 and Java 9.
* [Flexmark](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java) is used for the Markdown parser and renderer.
* [H2](http://h2database.com/html/main.html) is used for database functions.
* Full text search is done with [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/).

### Clojure Stuff ###

* Developed and tested with Clojure 1.8 and 1.9.
* [Buddy](https://github.com/funcool/buddy) is used for authentication.
* [clj-time](https://github.com/clj-time/clj-time) is used for formatting and handling time-related things.
* [clj-yaml](https://github.com/circleci/clj-yaml) (the maintained fork) is used to parse YAML front matter when pages are imported from files.
* [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) is used for routing.
* [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) is used for "lispy" creation of HTML.
* [http-kit](http://www.http-kit.org) is used as the server software.
* [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) is the web applications library.
* [url](https://github.com/cemerick/url) is used for manipulating URLs.

### Everything Else ###

#### Database ####

CWiki uses the [H2](http://h2database.com/html/main.html) database for the database functions of the wiki. It is perhaps not as "heavy duty" as some other possibilities. However, it has the tremendous benefit that it requires no administration by the user.

Earlier in development, the program used [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/). However, it proved too cumbersome (and slow) for continued use in this project.

#### Editor ####

The editor used to be just an HTML text field. After seeing some examples of simple editors written in JavaScript (like [Writing](https://github.com/josephernest/Writing/) by Joseph Ernest), and notably, the [Markdown editor](https://github.com/lacarmen/reagent-markdown-editor)â€‹ written by Carmen La as an example of React, I wrote my own in ClojureScript. Now it's what I use it for just about everything even though it is quite primitive.

#### CSS ####

At this point, the CSS used is just plain old [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_intro.asp). I strongly considered using [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), but did not want the additional dependency on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to build the project. This may change in the future.

You can use the CSS files to re-style CWiki to your liking.

## Tests ##

Tests have not been written systematically. I tend to write them when I'm having difficulty with something. There are a few scattered around now. They will grow.

## Security ##

There really isn't any. 

* Don't put anything in CWiki that you wouldn't want someone else to see. 
* Don't put CWiki on a remote server. It could be hacked easily to steal your information or post someone else's.

Authentication is session based requiring a username and password.

Authorization is home-grown and based on the roles users have been assigned. See [[About Roles]] for more information.

## How Pages Get Rendered ##

The pages in CWiki are a mashup of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [[Wikilinks]], and [[About TeX|$\rm\TeX$]]. No single parser/HTML generator handles all of those pieces. So rendering a page happens in several stages.

1. First, all of the WikiLinks are located and translated to HTML-style links. These links point to pages within the CWiki database. If there is no such page, the link is displayed in red. Clicking on a red link will open an empty page in the editor ready for creation.
2. The Markdown content, including the translated WikiLinks, are converted to HTML. Since Markdown parsers pass HTML through unaltered, the translated WikiLinks are left intact.
3. Finally, the HTML is passed to MathJax to translate any $\rm\TeX$ into something that can be displayed in a web page. The representation is usually common HTML, but you can change that if needed.
4. That big chunk of HTML is plugged into the `<body>` section of a web page containing the header and footer for the page as well as the `<head>` section required for well-formed HTML5
5. That page is then served by a web-server built into CWiki (http-kit, mentioned above) and rendered by your browser.

## Other Issues ##

### Multiple Users ###

Originally, CWiki was envisioned as a private wiki for use by a single person. However, after showing it around a bit. Other members of my family asked if they could use it too.

Of course, they could have set up their own instances, but they wanted to use the same one I was using. So... the capability for multiple users on the same wiki was added. See the sections on authentication and authorization for details.

But, CWiki is by no means "multi-user" in the sense of multiple users running the program simultaneously. There is nothing to prevent it, but there are no facilities to guarantee exclusive access to the database or pages in those circumstances.

### Namespaces ###

Whether or not to implement namespaces for pages is an open question at this point.

When I look at the pages created during installation, there are lots of the form "About...". Maybe those should be made part of a "Help" namespace freeing up those titles for other uses in additional namespaces. For example, it might be useful for a user to create project-specific namespaces or namespaces for work-related research _vs_. research done for home-based projects.

### Which Version of Markdown to Use ###

Markdown by itself is a great way to write some things. It is intended to be simple and can do those simple things well. It is intended to be readable above all. And that works most of the time for short, simple projects.

But Markdown cannot handle some use cases that are very common, like producing tables. As a result, lots of "extensions" have developed over the years to help fill some of those needs.

Also, Markdown syntax as initially laid down by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) is ambiguous, so various implementations have diverged causing users sometimes to be surprised when the same document produces different results in different programs.

Developers, including myself, have been forced to improvise. To get what I want most -- simple formatting, multi-line code listings, and math formatting -- I've put together yet another Frankenstein version of Markdown that includes those things. So, starting with basic Markdown, I've added:

* A much simplified version of [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)-style [wikilinks](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links#Internal_links).
* [GitHub-flavored](https://github.github.com/gfm/) [fenced code blocks](https://github.github.com/gfm/#fenced-code-blocks).
* GitHub-flavored [strikethrough syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/#strikethrough-extension-).
* GitHub-flavored [table syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-).
* Mathematics formatting using [$\rm\TeX$](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) syntax being rendered by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

Surprisingly, as described above, a rendering pipeline can be constructed that will handle all of these things.

### Deleting Users ###

Deleting a user from a wiki is a pretty extreme measure. Then there is the question of what to do with anything they have written.

The approach taken by CWiki is to go ahead and delete the account, but make no effort to find and remove anything they have worked on. When pages that the deleted user authored are viewed, the author will be listed as "Unknown". The work of all deleted users will be shown with an "Unknown" author. There is no attempt to differentiate which deleted user may have authored something. It is up to the admin or an editor to revise or delete any material the deleted user may have created.

Deleting a user like this loses attribution for any work they may have done. This is generally not a good thing. Another, gentler approach would be for an admin to simply change the password for the deleted user such that they could no longer access their (former) account. That way the attribution remains, but the deleted user no longer has rights to create new content. (They can always sign in on the "guest" account to view anything in the wiki.)

### Handling Images ###

Mainly, I punted on this one. Since CWiki is at heart a single-user, private wiki, it would make sense to put embedded images in the database. There are safety and reliability benefits from doing this.

At the moment though,  images can be embedded by links to online resources or the file system.

See [[About Images]].

### Rendering Mathematics ###

This was a no-brainer. MathJax is just terrific. But where to retrieve it from? The most performant option is probably from a CDN. But that's a pretty large initial download. Another option would be to load it directly on the server. But does that mean I have to keep an additional ~15-20MB of files in the repository?

At this point, I'll just use it from the CDN until, and if, it becomes a problem.

### Handling Quoted Wikilinks ###

In order to show examples of wikilinks in documentation, you should quote them. A user should be able to quote them using the backqoute ("\`"), triple backquotes  ("\`\`\`"), `<code></code>` tags or `<pre></pre>` tags.

However, the strategy I have been using has just been using regular expressions to find the wikilink markers, "\[\[" and "\]\]", use the contents between the markers to build a link, and replace the contents with the link.

Doing it that way causes examples of wikilinks embedded in a quoted section to be replaced anyway. Need to handle it differently.

It seems like there are four possible approaches.

1. Do nothing and warn users "don't do that". Least desirable.
2. Try to refine the regular expression-based approach I'm using now. Regular expressions are not a good way (even a possible way?) to handle embedded HTML.
3. Write a small parser to handle pages looking for quoted blocks. I think this would require me to re-work the dataflow from several passes over the text to one that does the translation in a single pass.
4. Since I'm using flexmark-java as my Markdown to HTML processor, look into the Wikilinks extension. I'm not sure how to handle special formatting for special cases like graying admin pages and making links to non-existent pages red. I'm not sure how extensible it is if I want to add things like namespaces either.

I filed an issue with the flexmark developers, and they pointed me to [this issue and discussion](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java/issues/30).

#### Resolved ####

This issue was actually fixed by creating a custom `WikiLinkAttributeProvider` and extension. It styles (colors) the links just like always but is done in the Markdown parser rather than using a regular expression to match and resolve links. It did point out a flaw in the way I was constructing the links on the "All Users" and "All Tags" pages. Now they are built using the more standard query string syntax rather than my previous _ad hoc_ method.

There was a pre-existing extension to handle wikilinks within the flexmark parser. All I had to do was include it and write the attribute provider mentioned above.â€‹
