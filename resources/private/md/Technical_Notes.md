These are some technical notes about CWiki. If you are only interested in using the wiki, you can ignore this stuff. If you want to know how CWiki works or how to build and modify your own version, the information here might be useful.

## Motivation ##

## Software Dependencies ##

Almost no software is written without dependencies these days -- programs are just too complicated. CWiki is no different. Some useful functionality has already been written by others. Here's a list.

### Java Stuff ###
### Clojure Stuff ###
### Everything Else ###

## Tests ##

## Security ##

There really isn't any. 

* Don't put anything in CWiki that you wouldn't want someone else to see. 
* Don't put CWiki on a remote server. It could be easily hacked to steal your information and post someone else's.

## The CSS ##

You can use the CSS file to re-style CWiki to your liking.
