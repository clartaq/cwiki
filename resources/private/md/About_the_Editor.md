CWiki includes a simple Markdown editor with real-time preview. It is not fancy, but in my own work, it is very low friction.

The editor consists of three main areas.

1. The title area lets you edit the page title.
2. The tags area lets you manage the tags associated with a page.
   1. To edit a tag, click the tag and make your changes.
   2. To delete a tag, click the circled "x" next to the tag.
   3. To add a new tag, click the circled "+" at the end of the list of tags.
3. The main editing section is where you will spend most of your time.

## The Main Editing Section ##

CWiki divides the main editing area into sections too.

### Shortcut Keys ###

Just like most editors, CWiki recognizes keyboard shortcuts. Some are fairly generic and are used by most editors (copy, paste, delete, and so on.) Others are specific to CWiki. See [[About Keyboard Shortcuts]] for more information.

### When You are Done ### 

## Tips ##

Save your work often. If you navigate away from the editor, by refreshing the page or clicking a link in the Preview pane, you will lose any unsaved work.

## One More Thing ##

Note that Grammarly compatibility seems to be browser dependent. I use it on Safari, where it works well.
