During development, a bug was noticed in the import function in that after deleting a page and then re-importing it; it would not show up in the [[All Pages]] page.

It turned out that the "referring page" passed through many of the functions involved pointed back to the page that does the deletion. This referer argument is used by many functions in the program so that they can return to where some action started once that operation is complete.

So, although the page appeared to import correctly, it was immediately deleted when the final confirmation page was acknowledged, and the program attempted to return to the page where the import started.

Tracing the way the referer was passed along from function to function was easy. Modifying things so that the referer pointed somewhere else was complicated and error-prone.

Rather than a long, complicated mess to modify the referer in unusual circumstances, something else was tried.

It seems logical that upon completing an import, the user would want to see the page just imported. So, once the import completes, the program displays the imported page rather than trying to return to where the import process started. Simple.
