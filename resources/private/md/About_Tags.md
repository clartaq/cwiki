Tags are a convenience that lets you classify your information in some (hopefully) systematic way. They are just words or short phrases that you can associate with a page.

You can organize things such that pages with the same tag have some relationship with one another. For example suppose you have a set of pages about markup languages. They might be titled and tagged like this:

- Title: XML
	- Tag: Markup Language
	- Tag: XML
- Title: HTML
	- Tag: Markup Language
	- Tag: HTML
- Title: Markdown
	- Tag: Markup Language
	- Tag: Markdown

And so on.

When you create or edit a page, you can create or delete tags associated with that page. When you view a page, the tags for the page will be shown near the top. If the page has no tags, it will say "None".

Some of the characteristics of tags include:

- Tags are always associated with at least one page.
- Tags may be of any length up to limits imposed by the operating system and hardware.  Theoretically, the could be billions of characters long.
- There is no theoretical limit on the number of tags associated with a page. However, due to limitations in the editing capabilities of CWiki, you can only enter 10. This may change in the future.
- The contents of a tag, the characters making it up, are [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16). This means you can use just about any symbol in any language in the world. This has not been thoroughly tested though.
