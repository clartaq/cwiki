Tags are a convenience that lets you classify your information in some (hopefully) systematic way. They are just words or short phrases that you can associate with a page.

You can organize things such that pages with the same tag have some relationship with one another. For example, suppose you have a set of pages about markup languages. They might be titled and tagged like this:

- Title: XML
	- Tag: Markup Language
	- Tag: XML
- Title: HTML
	- Tag: Markup Language
	- Tag: HTML
- Title: Markdown
	- Tag: Markup Language
	- Tag: Markdown

And so on.

When you create or edit a page, you can create or delete tags associated with that page. When you view a page, the tags for the page appear near the top. If the page has no tags, it will say "None."

When working in the tag editing area, you can navigate between tags by pressing the "Tab" key to move forward or the "Shift Tab" key to move backward. As a convenience, when a tag editor is focused, you can press the "Enter" key to create a new tag and focus it. You can just start typing in the new tag editor.

Some of the characteristics of tags include:

- Tags are always associated with at least one page.
- Tags may be of any length up to limits imposed by the operating system and hardware.  Theoretically, they could be billions of characters long.
- There is no theoretical limit on the number of tags associated with a page. However, problems may occur if you add enough tags to push the editing area for the main page content below the bottom of the browser window and out of view​.
- The contents of a tag, the characters making it up, are [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16). This means you can use just about any symbol in any language in the world. This has not been thoroughly tested though.
