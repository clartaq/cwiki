This is the "About" page for your wiki. It is just like any other page in the wiki except that there is always a link to it in the menu bar at the top of the browser window. It's in the "More" drop-down menu.

It is suggested that you write a statement about the general purpose of your wiki here.

This is CWiki version 0.1.9-SNAPSHOT.
