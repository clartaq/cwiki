Here are some other open-source wikis that I find interesting. Some of these are quite mature and very polished. Each has an opinionated approach to information management that works very smoothly when used as intended. Of course, each is missing something that I want. Otherwise, I would not have found it necessary to write CWiki.

## WikiPad ##
## TiddlyWiki ##

I have used TiddlyWiki for many years.

**Pros**
- All of your data is in one (almost) human-readable file.
- Very flexible and customizable.

**Cons**
- Can get very slow with a large collection of data.

## CherryTree ##
## TreeSheets ##
## MediaWiki ##
## XWiki ##

Each of these has pluses and minuses. Obvious, or I wouldn't have written CWiki.
