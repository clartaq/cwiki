This is the "Pages Primer", a brief introduction to creating, editing, and deleting pages in the wiki.

Here is an internal link to another page in this wiki about [[Other Wiki Software]].

Here is a link to a [[Non-Existent Page]] so you can see what that looks like. Just like links to existing pages, the links to non-existent pages can have [[Non-Existent Page|display text]] and link text. You can click the link to create and edit the page. That's how you create new pages in CWiki, create a link with the title of the new page, click the new link, and edit it. CWiki knows which pages already exist and which do not.

When you are done editing, use the "Save Changes" button below the edit area to save the new page. The next time you see the link, it will look like all the other links that point to real pages.
