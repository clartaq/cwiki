### For the MDE Editor ###

What is happening with this editor now?
Here is a list ofâ€‹ some of the things it can do.

* It can do a live preview of Markdown, like **bold** and _italic_.
* It can preview syntax highlighting.
* It can preview math typesetting.

Some inline code: `(+ 1 2 4 9)`.
And a code block:

```clojure
(defn plus-one
  [x]
  (+ 1 x))
```

Here's a [link](example.com).

Here's a [[wikilink]] to a page that doesn't exist.

Here's a [[Wikilinks|wikilink]] to a page that _does_ exist.

There are some ~~other~~ formatting commands too. You should check out some sites that have tests for Markdown compliance.

Some math inline $\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$ and some
on it's own line:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\mu)^2}
$$

Looks good, huh?
