# CWiki ##

CWiki is a simple personal wiki application. You use your browser to view and edit the content. It runs on your local machine. You can link to external sites on the internet, but the content you create stays on your computer.

## Warning ##

CWiki is pre-alpha software. It does useful things, but many planned features are not present. (The program will usually tell you so if you try to do something that it cannot accomplish yet. Or it might just crash.) Probably full of bugs too.

## Features ##

* Written in Clojure
* You can link between pages, just like any other wiki.
* Uses the [H2](http://h2database.com/html/main.html) database to store your information locally without requiring any administration on your part.
* Since it uses H2 as the database, there is no DB administration needed.
* Uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to write and markup pages in the wiki.
* Uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to produce nicely formatted mathematics. (Requires an active link to the internet at the moment.)
* Full text search is done using [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org).
* Includes a straightforward editor with live preview.
* Your content can be exported at any time as Markdown with [YAML](http://yaml.org) front-matter. There is no lock-in.
* The program is so simple, even I can understand it -- most of the time.

## Prerequisites ##

Java 8 or later must be installed to do development or run the program.

To build the program, you will need [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 1.7.0 or above installed. Just run `lein start-prod` from a command shell in the main project directory to start the program. Leiningen will take care of downloading all the dependencies for you.

## Creating and Running a Standalone Program ##

To create a stand-alone program, execute `lein uberjar`. 

After the build process finishes, you can run the program from the command line with

```
java -jar target/cwiki-0.0.11-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```

Your version number may be different.

You can also download one of the pre-built versions in the [download area](https://bitbucket.org/David_Clark/cwiki/downloads/). Note that early versions
may only work when launched within the directory structure of the project, not
from any random directory on you system.

 When running for the very first time, there will be a pause of several seconds as the database containing the initial wiki content is created. The program will start a local web server and start up your default web browser to display the initial content of the wiki.
